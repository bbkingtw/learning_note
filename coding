    so better coding is our only solution 
    
how to make us a better coder
    don't repleat code (copy paste)
    AVOID WRITING LONG CODE LINES
    ORGANIZE YOUR PROGRAM INTO SMALLER FILES
    CODE REFACTORING
    version controling
    give some time yourself
    Use Descriptive Names to delcare variables
    Readability > Cleverness
    there would be a more better function library somewhere, if now, how about write one 
    build platform, not build system, let system grow up on platform
    build library instead of build function
    build DataMart not build table, reduce SQL loading and prevent SQL complexity
    
what's on the right track

what's we could do more better

what about the URD, some important rules
    memory could fade away, write it down (could be very simple)
    frequently modified request could mean user not think it through
